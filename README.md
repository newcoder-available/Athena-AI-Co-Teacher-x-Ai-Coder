# Athena — AI Co-Teacher x AI Coder

**The Agora Voice AI Hackathon by AI Mobile Coders | Powered by Agora Conversational AI**

Athena is a next-generation voice-first platform combining two powerful real-time mobile & web experiences:
1. **AI Co-Teacher Classroom**: Live multi-party voice channel with Agora RTC + Conversational AI. Spoken quizzes with countdown cards, student floor requests, live speech-to-text transcripts, and teacher hard-mute override.
2. **AI Voice Coder (Mobile Pair Programmer)**: Hands-free voice coding assistant. Ask Athena to explain complex algorithms, detect bugs, analyze time complexity, and step through code line-by-line in real-time.

Built with **Agora Conversational AI Engine** (Deepgram STT → LLM Reasoning → MiniMax/ElevenLabs TTS), Next.js 16 Web App, and a dedicated **React Native / Expo Mobile App** (`apps/mobile`).

**No external API keys needed beyond Agora.** Speech recognition, LLM reasoning, and natural voice synthesis are orchestrated natively through Agora RTC + ConvoAI.

## Quick start

### 1. Credentials

You need one Agora project with **RTC + RTM + Conversational AI** enabled.

```bash
agora login
agora project create classroom-coteacher --feature rtc --feature convoai   # convoai implies rtm
agora project use classroom-coteacher
agora project env --with-secrets                                            # prints App ID + App Certificate
```

Then **hand-edit both env files** with those two values (the CLI's
`agora project env write` emits `AGORA_APP_ID` / `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`, but
this repo reads the `NEXT_`-prefixed names):

`apps/web/.env.local`
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=<App ID>
NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=<App Certificate>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://localhost:8787
```

`apps/orchestrator/.env`
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=<App ID>
NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=<App Certificate>
PORT=8787
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://localhost,capacitor://localhost
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

No Customer ID / Secret is needed — the `agora-agents` SDK runs in App
Credentials mode and mints the ConvoAI token itself.

> **Note for Android App:** For the Capacitor Android WebView shell, include
> `https://localhost` and `capacitor://localhost` (or your Cloudflare tunnel URL)
> in `CORS_ORIGINS` so the mobile student view can reach the orchestrator SSE stream.

> **After changing credentials, fully restart both servers.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is
> baked in when the web server starts.

#### Teachers can bring their own Agora project

The pair above is the deployment's **shared** project, and Agora's free tier
meters it — once its minutes run out, every classroom stops until someone
rotates the env vars and redeploys. So the join screen has an **Agora project**
panel (under *Join as teacher*) where a teacher must enter their own App ID and
App Certificate before the Create / Join buttons enable (the ? icon lists where
to find them in Agora Console):

- **Signed in** (`/login`): saved to their account in the orchestrator's
  Postgres; every lesson they create, on any device, runs on their project.
  The certificate is stored AES-256-GCM encrypted and is never returned by the
  API. This needs `DATABASE_URL` plus one new orchestrator env var:

  ```
  CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<any long random string>   # openssl rand -hex 32
  ```

  and the migration applied: `pnpm --filter @echosphere/orchestrator db:migrate`.
  Rotating the key invalidates every saved certificate (teachers re-enter theirs).

- **Not signed in**: kept in that browser's localStorage and sent with each
  lesson the teacher creates from it (`agora` field on `POST /api/sessions`).

The requirement is enforced in the UI only: the orchestrator still falls back
to the shared project for a request that arrives without one, so students and
scripted callers are unaffected. The project is resolved once at lesson
creation and pinned to the session, so token minting,
the ConvoAI agent join, and the App ID each student receives all come from the
same place — and a teacher editing credentials mid-class does not affect a
running lesson. The env pair is now optional: with neither shared credentials
nor a teacher-supplied pair, lesson creation is refused with a message saying
which to add, rather than the orchestrator refusing to boot.

### 2. Install and run

```bash
pnpm install
```

**Start both (one terminal):**
```bash
pnpm run dev:classroom      # orchestrator :8787 + web :3000, in parallel
```

**Or one each, if you want their logs separate:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 — orchestration backend on :8787
pnpm --filter @echosphere/orchestrator dev

# Terminal 2 — web app on :3000
pnpm --filter @echosphere/web dev

# Terminal 3 — Android Mobile App (Capacitor)
pnpm --filter @echosphere/mobile build:android   # or npx cap open android
```

Open <http://localhost:3000/join> for Web or run the Android app via Android Studio / `adb install`.

**Stop both:**
```bash
pkill -f "src/server.ts"     # orchestrator
pkill -f "src/server.ts"          # web
```

Confirm they are actually down before restarting — a half-dead process holding
a port is the usual reason a fresh start fails with `EADDRINUSE`:
```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:8787 -sTCP:LISTEN   # orchestrator; no output = stopped
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN   # web
```

> **Ctrl-C on the orchestrator does not always finish.** It runs under
> `tsx --watch`, and an open SSE connection from a browser tab keeps the process
> alive, so shutdown can hang at `Waiting for graceful termination...`. The same
> applies to the automatic restart after you edit a file under
> `apps/orchestrator/src/` — it can stall instead of coming back, leaving
> nothing listening on :8787. If that happens, `pkill -f "src/server.ts"` and
> start it again.

> **Restarting the orchestrator wipes every live classroom.** Sessions, the
> transcript, quizzes and the whiteboard scene are held in memory in
> `sessionRegistry.ts`, not in Postgres, so a restart ends any lesson in
> progress. Avoid editing orchestrator source while a session you care about is
> running.

### 3. For a demo or when sharing — run production, not dev

`next dev`'s Fast Refresh re-evaluates modules on every edit, which over a long
session desyncs the RTM client and produces `Ins id is 2` / `Offset is outside
the bounds of the DataView` errors in the console. For anything you're showing
or sharing, run the production build instead:

```bash
pnpm --filter @echosphere/web build
pnpm --filter @echosphere/web start     # :3000, no Fast Refresh
```

### 4. Sharing the frontend with someone else

It's a **two-service app** — the other person's browser must reach both `:3000`
(web) *and* `:8787` (orchestrator). Agora audio/transcripts connect
browser→Agora directly, so those work across machines automatically.

**Same wifi:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://<your-lan-ip>:8787` in
`apps/web/.env.local`, add `http://<your-lan-ip>:3000` to `CORS_ORIGINS`,
restart both, share `http://<your-lan-ip>:3000/join`.

**Anywhere (tunnel):**
```bash
brew install cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787   # -> ORCHESTRATOR url
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000   # -> WEB url
```
Then point `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` at the orchestrator tunnel, add the
web tunnel origin to `CORS_ORIGINS` (exact, `https://`, no trailing slash),
restart both. Both must be tunnelled — an `https://` page can't call
`http://localhost`.

### 5. Android Mobile App (Capacitor)

The student experience can be built and run as an Android application via Capacitor (`apps/mobile`), wrapping the live web app with native audio permissions, haptics, and background keep-alive.

**Configuration:**
Set `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL` in `apps/mobile` or use `capacitor.config.ts`:
- **Android Emulator**: `http://10.0.2.2:3000` (default)
- **Physical Device (LAN)**: `http://<your-lan-ip>:3000` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
- **Remote / Cloudflare Tunnel**: `https://<web-tunnel-id>.trycloudflare.com`

**Build and Run steps:**
```bash
# 1. Sync web assets and Capacitor plugins
cd apps/mobile
npx cap sync android

# 2. Build debug APK using Gradle:
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug      # on Windows: .\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
cd ..

# 3. Or open in Android Studio:
npx cap open android

# 4. Install the debug APK to connected device / emulator:
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Running a lesson

1. **Teacher** joins in one browser profile (`/join` → name → *Teacher* → *Start
   fractions demo (LCD)* or type a title). Lands on `/teacher/<id>`.
2. **Students** join in separate profiles / incognito windows (each needs a
   distinct browser session — Agora rejects a duplicated identity). They land on
   `/classroom/<id>`.
3. Teacher presses **Bring Athena in**. Her greeting plays in every browser and
   appears in the transcript.
4. By default the floor is **closed to students** — Athena listens and builds
   context but only the teacher can call on her. Toggle **Let students ask** to
   open it; then a student saying *"Athena, …"* gets an answer.
5. **Start Quiz** (with a topic) → Athena asks a **set of 3 questions**, one at a
   time. Each pops a card for every student with a 15-second countdown; when
   everyone answers or the timer runs out it reveals the answer and advances.
6. **Mute Athena** cuts her off mid-sentence and is an absolute veto until you
   press Resume.
7. **End lesson** generates the post-class summary inline.

Athena being *tuned in and listening but silent* is the design — a lesson where
she says nothing is a success, not a failure.

## Architecture at a glance

```
apps/web           Next.js frontend (extended from the Agora ConvoAI quickstart)
apps/orchestrator  Long-lived Node service — the brain:
                     roles · floor state machine · lesson material · quiz engine
                     · gap detector · post-class report
packages/shared-types  Domain types shared by both
```

**Audio** flows over Agora RTC. Every browser subscribes to every other
participant plus Athena; there is no video anywhere.

**Athena** is a single `agora-agents` ConvoAI agent (Deepgram → `gpt-4o-mini` →
MiniMax) that the teacher's browser starts. She joins with `remoteUids: ['*']`
so she hears the whole room.

**The control path is SSE, not RTM.** Agora's RTM SDK is browser-only, so the
orchestrator can't publish to the channel. It fans classroom events
(roster, floor state, quiz cards, gaps, policy) out over
`GET /api/sessions/:id/events` and takes commands back over plain HTTP. RTM is
still used for what it's good at — carrying Athena's own transcripts and state
from Agora's engine to the browser, which the teacher's tab relays back to the
orchestrator.

**Everything Athena knows lives in her system prompt.** With no custom LLM
endpoint, the orchestrator composes the whole classroom — roster with each
student's level, teacher policy, lesson material — into the prompt and re-pushes
it with `session.update()` whenever any of it changes. Inspect the live prompt
with `GET /api/sessions/:id/prompt`.

**Structured data comes back through the agent's history.** Athena appends one
JSON object per turn — the quiz she just asked, a gap she noticed, who she's
answering. MiniMax `skipPatterns: [5]` keeps it out of the spoken audio. The
orchestrator reads it from `agentSession.getHistory()` (the raw LLM output),
because the engine also strips it from the RTM transcript the browser relays.

### Turn-taking

The rule the plan cares most about — *no code path can let Athena speak while
muted* — is structural:

- `decideSpeak` in [`floor/floorMachine.ts`](apps/orchestrator/src/floor/floorMachine.ts)
  is the only function that grants permission; it checks `policy.muted` first
  and returns a discriminated union, not a boolean.
- `requestFloor` in [`classroomController.ts`](apps/orchestrator/src/classroomController.ts)
  is its only caller — one door for every path that can make Athena talk.
- Denials are broadcast to the teacher panel, so a blocked attempt is visible.

The floor machine is a pure function of `(snapshot, policy, input)`, tested
without an Agora connection ([`floor.test.ts`](apps/orchestrator/scripts/floor.test.ts),
[`floorMachine.test.ts`](apps/orchestrator/scripts/floorMachine.test.ts)).

Two things the plan didn't anticipate:

- **ConvoAI answers on its own initiative** — it never asks the orchestrator
  first. The orchestrator's lever is after the fact: the browser relays
  `AGENT_STATE_CHANGED`, and `handleAgentState` interrupts a turn that had no
  permit. A turn once *authorized* runs to completion — only an explicit mute,
  barge-in, or floor-close ends it early, never a stale clock read.
- **The engine can't tell the teacher from a student** (it has no speaker
  identity), so with the floor closed it stays silent even for the teacher. When
  the orchestrator sees the *teacher* address Athena by name it drives the reply
  explicitly with a `[classroom:system]` directive.

### Engine-level barge-in is not speaker-scoped

`interrupt_duration_ms` fires for *any* subscribed uid — a multi-party room
needs `remoteUids: ['*']`, so a student's stray "okay" mid-answer is
indistinguishable at the engine level from a teacher barging in. Both VAD
thresholds are pinned to Agora's documented ceiling to make the misfire rare;
the orchestrator's own `interruptAgent()`, gated to the teacher in
`onTeacherBargeIn`, is the one barge-in path that *is* speaker-scoped. A
platform limitation, mitigated not fixed.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint
pnpm --filter @echosphere/orchestrator test     # 80 checks — control parser, floor/permit, quiz set, tokens
pnpm --filter @echosphere/web build
pnpm --filter @echosphere/web test:e2e          # real browser, both servers up, fake mic
pnpm --filter @echosphere/web test:roundtrip    # live agent: she speaks, words + quiz card come back (Agora minutes)
```

`test:roundtrip` is the one that matters. It puts a **student** in the room
(which triggers `session.update()`), starts the agent, and asserts her words —
and a quiz card, with its countdown — come back through the full pipeline. Every
serious bug in this project passed typecheck, lint, and the API tests and only
showed up here.

## What works, and what doesn't

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Multi-party RTC, teacher/student roles, identity | ✅ |
| Turn-taking — mute, floor, teacher override, per-turn authorization | ✅ solid |
| Spoken quizzes — 3-question sets, 15s timer, voice or tap answers, auto-advance | ✅ |
| Lesson grounding — teacher's material in the prompt, her terminology | ✅ |
| Per-student explanation depth — level tags in the roster, live retag | ✅ |
| Post-class summary — per-student stats, gaps, concept mastery | ✅ (narrative is templated, not LLM-written — nothing to call) |
| Multilingual | ⚠️ one language at a time via `STT_LANGUAGE` (`hi`, `es`, …). Deepgram's `multi` code-switch mode returns nothing through the resale path — do not use it. |
| `{to}` / `{gap}` on ordinary turns | ⚠️ still read from the RTM relay, which strips them — so live "who is she answering" attribution and agent-noticed gaps are unreliable. Quiz payloads are read from history and work. |
| Restraint Meter | the orb reflects real floor decisions (listening / speaking / held-back); the LLM "intervention gate" behind it stays dormant (needs a public tunnel + BYOK key). |
| Persistence | in-memory; lost on orchestrator restart unless `DATABASE_URL` is set (Postgres schema + migration exist). A second replica would need sticky routing by `sessionId`. |
| Transcription quality | the browser tests use a fake tone, so they prove the pipeline connects but not how well real speech transcribes. |

The quickstart's original 1:1 routes (`app/api/invite-agent`, etc.) are still
present and still work, but aren't wired to any page — kept as the proven
baseline reference.
